<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  While it did make for some extremely tasty Asian-style lettuce wraps, you can
  use flap meat in so many other wonderful ways. You should try this in tacos or
  Philly cheese steak. I used the grilled meat with lettuce, carrots, red
  onions, chopped peanuts, and cilantro leaves to make a salad. For the dressing
  I combined the reserved meat juices, sambal, fish sauce, and rice vinegar to
  taste. I didn't measure anything, and neither should you.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons green curry paste</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar, or more to taste</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons coconut milk</li>
  <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
  <li>1 pinch salt</li>
  <li>2 pounds flap steak, trimmed of fat</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Whisk curry paste, fish sauce, rice vinegar, coconut milk, black pepper,
    cayenne pepper, and salt together in a large shallow glass or ceramic bowl.
    Add the flap steak and turn to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
    and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the flap meat from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard
    remaining marinade.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
  <li>
    Cook flap steak on the preheated grill until it starts to firm and is
    reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An
    instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F
    (54 degrees C). Transfer meat to a plate to rest for at least five minutes
    before slicing against the grain.
